# Spotify Clone - Frontend UI

This project is a front-end clone of the Spotify music streaming platform, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It focuses on recreating the visual appearance and user interface of Spotify's web application.

## 🎯 Project Description

The clone consists of the following main components:

- **Login Page** – A static page where users can enter their credentials to simulate logging in.
- **Signup Page** – A simple form for new users to register (visual only, no backend functionality).
- **User Interface** – The main dashboard that imitates Spotify's layout. It includes:
  - A sidebar with navigation links
  - A top navigation bar
  - A main content area with playlists, album covers, and song titles
  - A footer music player layout (non-functional)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## 📌 Note

This is a static front-end project. No JavaScript or backend functionality is included — the login, signup, and music player are for design/demo purposes only.
